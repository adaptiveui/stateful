#### @adaptiveui/stateful

A (in)finite state machine specialized in simplifying presentation logic.

The `Stateful` decorator can add state to any object. Typically an object would add a state variable or inherit state. With `Stateful` you add state capabilities to an object and manage that through a simple interface.

## Install

Install with npm.

```sh
npm install --save adaptiveui-stateful
```

Install with bower.

```sh
bower install --save adaptiveui-stateful
```

### Lodash Dependency

This library requires a small set of lodash. Use [lodash-modularize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-modularize) to limit how much of lodash is included in your project.

## Quick Usage

```js
import Stateful from "adaptiveui/stateful"

var object = {
  value: 'no state',
  action: function() {
    return this.value
  }
};

var stateful = Stateful(object);
var state = {
  onInvoke() {
    // first time it is assigned for an object
  },
  onEnter() {
    // every time it is transitioned to
  },  
  onExit() {
    // every time it is transitioned away
  },
  onDecorate(hostObject) {
    const { action } = hostObject;
    return {
      value: 'state',
      action() {
        return action() + ' applied';
      }
    }
  }
};

object.action() === 'no state';
stateful.pushState(state);
object.action() === 'state applied';

stateful.current() === [state];
state === stateful.popState();
```

## Usage

### Stateful API

When creating a `Stateful` for a host object you manage the current set of states applied through the `Stateful` object itself.

```js
var object = {
  action(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
};
var stateful = Stateful(object);
```

Once a `Stateful` object is created it can be used to transition to different states. Typically a state machine will benefit from allowing multiple states to be applied together. In this way, state definitions do not suffer from permutation explosion. For instance, instead of `OpenWarningState` and `OpenSuccessState` you can have `OpenState`, `CloseState`, `WarningState`, and `SuccessState`.

```js
stateful.transition([stateA, stateB]);
stateful.transition(stateA);
```

A `Stateful` object can have states applied over time, if different aspects of an application control the state of an object.

```js
stateful.transition([stateA, stateB]);
// ...is the same as...
stateful.popStates();
stateful.pushState(stateA);
stateful.pushState(stateB);
// ...is the same as...
stateful.popStates();
stateful.pushStates([stateA, stateB]);
```

A `Stateful` object remembers the transitions over time and can `rewind` state values, this is useful for _blips_ where you apply a state and then return to your previous state. As an example, if you were building a game you may want to go into attach mode, but go back to whatever you were doing after danger the danger is gone. A `Stateful` object tracks your last state.

```js
AttackState = {
  onEnter() {
    mediator.on('isEnemyFarAway', function() {
      // attack state does not know the last state, but it wants to end attacking
      stateful.rewind();
    });
  }
};
DetectEnemyState = {
  onEnter() {
    mediator.on('isEnemyNearby', function() {
      stateful.transition(AttackState);
    });
  }
};
stateful.transition([FarmState, DetectEnemyState]);
```

### State API

A state is a normal object with the following methods.

#### onInvoke

A method called the first time a state is applied to an object.

#### onEnter

A method called every time a state is applied to an object.

#### onExit

A method called every time a state is unapplied to an object.

#### onDecorate

A method which returns an object to override values and functions on the host object.

#### Example

A state with all properties and a sample object.

```js
var object = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  action1(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  },
  action2(a, b) {
    return this.a + this.b;
  }
};
```

A state might change or override this object could look like this. The `onEnter` and `onExit` methods should be functional reflections.

```js
var state = {
  onEnter() {
    this.a === 1;
    this.a = 2;
  },
  onExit() {
    this.a === 2;
    this.a = 1;
  }
}
```

A state may need to run setup functions once, with `onInvoke`.

```js
var state = function() {
  this.used = 0;
  this.onInvoke = function() {
    this.used += 1;
  }
}
```

A state can alter the host object with `onDecorate`.

```js
var state = {
  onDecorate(hostObject) {
    const { a } = hostObject;
    return {
      a(a, b) {
        // call the host method (this may have been altered by another state)
        return a(a, b) + a(a, b);
      },
      b() {
        // change the functionality completely
        return (this.a * 2) + (this.b * 2);
      }
    }
  }
}
```
