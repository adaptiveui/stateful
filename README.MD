#### @adaptiveui/stateful

A (in)finite state machine specialized in simplifying presentation logic.

## Install

Install with npm.

```sh
npm install --save @adaptiveui/stateful
```

Install with bower.

```sh
bower install --save adaptiveui-stateful
```

### Lodash Dependency

This library requires a small set of lodash. Use [lodash-modularize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-modularize) to limit how much of lodash is included in your project.

## Quick Usage

```js
import Stateful from "adaptiveui/stateful"

var state1 = {
  onInvoke() {
    // first time it is assigned for an object
  },
  onEnter() {
    // every time it is transitioned to
  },  
  onExit() {
    // every time it is transitioned away
  },
  onDestroy() {
    // when object is destroyed
  },
  onDecorate(stateEnabledObject) {
    return {
      f1() {

      }
    }
  }
};

var s1 = Stateful(this);

s1.push(state1);
s1.current() === state1;
s1.list() === [state1];
state1 = s1.pop();

```

## Usage
